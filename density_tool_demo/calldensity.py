# Call Density tool for Camano Island Fire Department
## This tool will process a call records document and
## return that document with some columns added. These
## columns will show which calls overlap with the call
## from that row and how many there were. It will only
## do this for calls that start *after* the call in
## that row. It will also do this with specific units,
## since multiple units can be involved in a call.
